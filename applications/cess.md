## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

* Tag line: An infrastructure of decentralized cloud network facilities based on Polkadot.
* Brief description: CESS are the trailblazers of decentralized cloud storage infrastructure built upon the foundation of blockchain and cloud storage. Utilizing blockchain technology, CESS makes effective use of online idle storage resources to establish an infinite distributed storage network of low capacity data nodes. Simultaneously, with the help of virtualization technology and cloud computing technology, it implements effective management of these resources to reprocess then redistribute data and provide users with a secure and efficient data storage service. In addition, CESS provides a trading platform template for efficiency, transparency and equality for all data owners based on the characteristics of blockchain. These owners in turn may independently manage their own data on the CESS network, including data sharing and data trading, so as to facilitate other users to mine the intrinsic value of data and yield its potential benefits.
* Indication 1: CESS plans to deploy in and enter the Polkadot ecosystem, creating a new decentralized cloud storage ecosystem, establishing a large-scale distributed storage network, and landing in commercial applications to meet the actual needs of commercial applications for large amounts of data storage.
* Indication 2: Whether it is the Internet, or the blockchain, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, all the storage, calculation, transmission, all are still around data. Decentralized distributed storage based on blockchain, with the leading advantage of data certainty, makes data storage security possible and enables cross-platform, cross-collaboration and cross- format interoperability of data. The technical features of de-centralized storage, including data privacy non-tampering, privatization, capitalization, and trusted underlying infrastructure, future digital economy, are "scalability" of distributed storage for future applications.  At the same time, distributed storage can provide a back-up aid for the underlying infrastructure, and it will inevitably spawn many applications.  Distributed storage networks can better drive the arrival of Web3.0 and are one of the underlying technical infrastructure of Web3.0.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
* What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  * This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Polkadot provides a multi-chain application environment and a decentralized relay chain. Parachains can exchange information and transactions in a way without trust through relay chain of Polkadot. CESS can provide a public convenient and secure storage service for the parachains which does not need to apply local storage so as to make reasonable use of the storage space.

CESS is a project for data storage. Similar projects in the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem include Ocean, DataHighway and Bluzelle. The differences between them are described in detail below.

* Ocean : It provides data processing, storage, computing and other services, helping to expand the data boundary, especially in the field of AI. It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology to allow data to be shared and traded in a secure and transparent manner. Comparatively, the purpose of CESS is to provide users with high-quality and low-cost storage services without data processing.
* DataHighway：It is oriented to the Internet of things and provides data market at cross-chain level in the form of DAO. Although the project also supports the data storage function, it still serves the Internet of things.
* Bluzelle：It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant Web3 distributed database. Developers pay to read and write the database. Although data storage is its basic function, it is still a data rental market in essence.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:


### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** 3 months
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  2
* **Total Costs:** 8,000 USD

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules

* **Estimated Duration:** 2 month
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 6,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial | We will publish an article/tutorial/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |
